# OpenSearch Dashboards Observability

The OpenSearch Dashboards Observability plugin has four components: Trace Analytics, Event Analytics, Operational Panels, and Notebooks. Event analytics allows user to use [PPL](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/ppl/index/) to query indices stored in OpenSearch. Users can also aggregate on their indices to automatically create visualizations, which can be added as operational panels similar to dashboards.

#### Trace Analytics

Trace Analytics page provides instant on dashboards in OpenSearch Dashboards for users to quickly analyze their logs. The plugin uses aggregated results from two indices, `otel-v1-apm-span-*` and `otel-v1-apm-service-map*` created by the otel-trace-raw-processor and service-map-processor, and renders three main views:

1. Dashboard: an overview of the trace groups and three charts: error rate, throughput, service map.

1. Traces: a table of top-level traces with unique trace id's, where users can click on any trace to see its end-to-end performance metrics, service performance metrics, and a span latency metrics in a Gantt chart.

1. Services: a table of the services, where users can click on a service to see its performance metrics and related services.

Additionally the fields can be sorted and filtered.

#### Notebooks

Dashboards offer a solution for a few selected use cases, and are great tools if youâ€™re focused on monitoring a known set of metrics over time. Notebooks enables contextual use of data with detailed explanations by allowing a user to combine saved visualizations, text, graphs and decorate data with other reference data sources.
