# Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana Notebooks

Dashboards offer a solution for a few selected use cases, and are great tools if you’re focused on monitoring a known set of metrics over time. Notebooks enables contextual use of data with detailed explanations by allowing a user to combine saved visualizations, text, graphs and decorate data in elastic with other reference data sources.

## Setup & Build

Complete Kibana Notebooks is composed of 2 plugins.

- [Kibana Notebooks plugin](./kibana-notebooks/README.md)
- [Notebooks ES plugin](./es-notebooks/)（TODO）
