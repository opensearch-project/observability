### Trace Analytics

Trace Analytics page provides instant on dashboards in OpenSearch Dashboards for users to quickly analyze their logs. The plugin uses aggregated results from two indices, `otel-v1-apm-span-*` and `otel-v1-apm-service-map*` created by the otel-trace-raw-processor and service-map-processor, and renders three main views:

1. Dashboard: an overview of the trace groups and three charts: error rate, throughput, service map.

1. Traces: a table of top-level traces with unique trace id's, where users can click on any trace to see its end-to-end performance metrics, service performance metrics, and a span latency metrics in a Gantt chart.

1. Services: a table of the services, where users can click on a service to see its performance metrics and related services.

Additionally the fields can be sorted and filtered.

### Event Analytics

Event Analytics allows user to monitor, correlate, analyze and visualize machine generated data through [Piped Processing Language](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/observability-plugins/ppl/index/). It also enables the user to turn data-driven events into visualizations and save frequently used ones for quick access.

### Operational Panels

Operational panels provides the users to create and view different visualizations on ingested observability data, using Piped Processing Language queries. Use PPL 'where clauses' and datetime timespans to filter all visualizations in the panel.

### Notebooks

Dashboards offer a solution for a few selected use cases, and are great tools if youâ€™re focused on monitoring a known set of metrics over time. Notebooks enables contextual use of data with detailed explanations by allowing a user to combine saved visualizations, text, graphs and decorate data with other reference data sources.
