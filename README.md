# OpenSearch Dashboards Trace Analytics

The OpenSearch Dashboards Trace Analytics plugin provides instant on dashboards in OpenSearch Dashboards for users to quickly analyze their logs. The plugin uses aggregated results from two indices, `otel-v1-apm-span-*` and `otel-v1-apm-service-map*` created by the otel-trace-raw-processor and service-map-processor, and renders three main views:

1. Dashboard: an overview of the trace groups and three charts: error rate, throughput, service map.

1. Traces: a table of top-level traces with unique trace id's, where users can click on any trace to see its end-to-end performance metrics, service performance metrics, and a span latency metrics in a Gantt chart.

1. Services: a table of the services, where users can click on a service to see its performance metrics and related services.

Additionally the fields can be sorted and filtered.
