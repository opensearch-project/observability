Notebooks let you interactively explore data by running different visualizations that you can share with team members to collaborate on a project.

A notebook is a document composed of two elements: code blocks (Markdown/SQL/PPL) and visualizations.

Common use cases include creating postmortem reports, designing runbooks, building live infrastructure reports, and writing documentation.

You can also generate [reports](https://opensearch.org/docs/dashboards/reporting/) directly from your notebooks.

For more information, refer to the [documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/dashboards/notebooks/).`,

OpenSearch makes its search and query engine robust by introducing Piped Processing Language (PPL).

PPL enables developers, DevOps engineers, support engineers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers to effectively discover and explore log data stored in OpenSearch.

With PPL, you can extract insights from your data with a sequence of commands delimited by pipes (|). PPL supports a comprehensive set of commands including search, where, fields, rename, dedup, sort, eval, head, top, and rare. PPL also supports functions, operators and expressions.

Even if you're new to OpenSearch and are only familiar with the pipe (|) syntax, you can still be productive from day one.`,

Query DSL is powerful and fast, but it has a steep learning curve because it doesn’t have a human-readable interface. It's also difficult to create ad hoc queries and explore your data. SQL lets you extract and analyze data in a declarative manner.

OpenSearch makes its search and query engine robust by introducing Piped Processing Language (PPL).

PPL enables developers, DevOps engineers, support engineers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers to effectively discover and explore log data stored in OpenSearch.

With PPL, you can extract insights from your data with a sequence of commands delimited by pipes (|). PPL supports a comprehensive set of commands including search, where, fields, rename, dedup, sort, eval, head, top, and rare. PPL also supports functions, operators and expressions.

Even if you're new to OpenSearch and are only familiar with the pipe (|) syntax, you can still be productive from day one.`,
