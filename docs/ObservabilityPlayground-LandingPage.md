# Observability

### OpenSearch Dashboards

Observability is collection of plugins and applications that let you visualize data-driven events by using Piped Processing Language to explore, discover, and query data stored in OpenSearch.
Your experience of exploring data might differ, but if youâ€™re new to exploring data to create visualizations, we recommend trying a workflow like the following:

1. Explore data within a certain timeframe using [Piped Processing Language](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/ppl/index).

2. Use [event analytics](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/observing-your-data/event-analytics) to turn data-driven events into visualizations.

3. Create [operational panels](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/observing-your-data/operational-panels) and add visualizations to compare data the way you like.

4. Use [log analytics](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/observing-your-data/event-analytics/) to transform unstructured log data.

5. Use [trace analytics](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/observing-your-data/trace/index) to create traces and dive deep into your data.

6. Leverage [notebooks](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/observing-your-data/notebooks) to combine different visualizations and code blocks that you can share with team members.
